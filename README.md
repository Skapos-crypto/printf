# printf

## Overview
`printf` is an implementation of a shell program, developed as a milestone project for the ALX Africa Software Engineering program. This project aims to replicate the functionalities of the `sh` UNIX command interpreter, providing students with a deeper understanding of advanced shell concepts, including:

- Process management  
- System calls  
- Bit manipulation  
- File management  
- Error handling  

This shell program is written entirely in **C**.

## Features
- Executes built-in shell commands.  
- Supports standard input and output redirection.  
- Implements basic error handling for invalid inputs or commands.  
- Includes bit manipulation operations for enhanced performance.  
- Mimics the behavior of the UNIX `sh` shell.  

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, contributors and users can:  
1. Understand how a shell works under the hood.  
2. Dive into system-level programming concepts in C.  
3. Gain familiarity with handling processes and system calls.  
4. Explore error-handling techniques and strategies.  

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skapos-crypto/printf.git
cd printf
```

### Build
Use the included `Makefile` for compilation:  
```bash
make
```
The shell binary will be generated in the current directory.

### Usage
Run the shell by executing the binary:  
```bash
./printf
```
You can then enter commands directly into the shell.

### Clean
To clean up compiled files:  
```bash
make clean
```

## File Structure
- **`main.c`**: Entry point of the shell.  
- **`shell.c`**: Core functionalities of the shell, including command parsing and execution.  
- **`utils.c`**: Utility functions for string manipulation, memory management, and error handling.  
- **`Makefile`**: Automates the build process.  
- **`README.md`**: Documentation of the project.
